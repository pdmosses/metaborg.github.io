# The Spoofax Language Workbench

Spoofax is a platform for developing textual (domain-specific) programming languages.
The platform provides the following ingredients:

- Meta-languages for high-level declarative language definition
- An interactive environment for developing languages using these meta-languages
- Code generators that produces parsers, type checkers, compilers, interpreters, and other tools from language definitions
- Generation of full-featured Eclipse editor plugins from language definitions
- An API for programmatically combining the components of a language implementation

With Spoofax you can focus on the essence of language definition and ignore irrelevant implementation details.

[Get started](getting-started.md) by downloading and installing Spoofax or build it [from source](https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax-releng).
