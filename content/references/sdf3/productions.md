# Productions

The basic building block of syntax sections is the production.
The left-hand side of a regular production rule can be either just a symbol or a symbol followed by ``.`` and a constructor name.
The right-hand side consists of zero or more symbols.
Both sides are separated by ``=``:

```
$Symbol              = $Symbol*
$Symbol.$Constructor = $Symbol*
```

A production is read as the definition.
The symbol on the left-hand side is defined by the right-hand side of the production.

Productions are used to describe [lexical](../lexical-syntax/), [context-free](../context-free-syntax/), and [kernel](../kernel-syntax/) syntax.
Productions may also occur in [priority sections](../disambiguation/#priorities), but might also be referred to by its ``$Symbol.$Constructor``.
All productions with the same symbol together define the alternatives for that symbol.


## Attributes

The definition of productions may be followed by attributes that define additional (syntactic or semantic) properties of that production.
The attributes are written between curly brackets after the right-hand side of a production.
If a production has more than one attribute they are separated by commas.
Attributes have thus the following form:

```
$Sort              = $Symbol* { $Attribute1, $Attribute2, ...}
$Sort.$Constructor = $Symbol* { $Attribute1, $Attribute2, ...}
```

The following syntax-related attributes exist:

-  ``bracket`` is an important attribute in combination with priorities. The parenthesizer tool uses the ``bracket`` attribute to find productions to add to a parse tree before pretty printing (when the tree violates priority constraints). Note that most of these tools demand the production with a ``bracket`` attribute to have the shape: ``X = "(" X ")" {bracket}`` with any kind of bracket syntax but the ``X`` being the same symbol on the left-hand side and the right-hand side. The connection with priorities and associativity is that when a non-terminal is disambiguated using either of them, a production rule with the ``bracket`` attribute is probably also needed.
-  ``reject`` is a disambiguation construct that implements language difference. It is used for keyword reservation. See [Disambiguation#Rejections](../disambiguation/#rejections).
-  ``left``, ``right``, ``non-assoc``, ``assoc`` are disambiguation constructs used to define the associativity of productions. See [Disambiguation#Associativity](../disambiguation/#associativity).
-  ``prefer`` and ``avoid`` are **deprecated** disambiguation constructs to define preference of one derivation over others. See [Disambiguation#Preferences](../disambiguation/#preference).
