# Scope Graph Constraints

One of the core concepts of Statix is modelling name binding structures using
_scope graphs_. Scope graphs consist of three different components, summarized
in the following table.

| Component   | Description                                                                                      | Textual Notation | Graphical notation  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Scope       | Region in a program with uniform behavior wrt. name resolution. Represented as nodes in a graph. | `#1`             | Circular node       |
| Edge        | Directed edges with upper-case labels model reachability between scopes.                         | `#1 -L-> #2`     | Labeled arrow       |
| Declaration | Declarations associate data terms with a particular scope under a particular relation.           | `#1 |-r-> d`     | Labeled block arrow |

Using these components, and leveraging the fact that scopes are regular terms,
many name-binding patterns can be modelled. In the remainder of this section,
we will explain how scope graph constraints can be expressed in the Statix language.


## Scopes

First, scopes can be created using the `new` keyword:

```statix
new $Var+
```

For each var in the list of variables provided to the new constraint, a fresh
scope is generated, and bound to that particular variable. Note that the `$Var`s
are _not_ introduced by this constraints, but rather have to be introduced earlier
in a [rule head](../rules#rule-definitions) or using an
[existential constraint](../basic-constraints#exists).

Statix guarantees that each scope has a unique identity. Scopes that are
generated by different `new` constraints can never be equal under the
[equality constraint](../basic-constraints#equality).


## Edges

The existence of edges in a scope graph can be asserted using edge assertion constraints:

```statix
$Term -$Label-> $Term
```

This constraint ensures that an edge from the first term argument to the last
argument (which must have type `scope`) with a label `$Label` exists.

??? info "Edge Assertions not Idempotent"
    Edge constraints are _not_ idempotent. That is, repeated edge assertions will
    result in multiple equivalent edges in a scope graph. However, because query
    results have set semantics, and edges have structural identity, declarations
    reached via such a duplicated edge will not be duplicated in a query answer.

    For example (assuming familiarity with [queries](../queries) and
    [tests](../test)), the constraint:
    ```statix
    {R s1 s2}
      new s1 s2,
      s1 -P-> s2,
      s1 -P-> s2,
      query () filter P in s1 |-> R
    ```
    will give the following (slightly simplified) result:
    ```statix
    substitution
      R |-> [(PathStep(PathEmpty(#s1), P, #s2), #s2)]

    analysis
      scope graph
        #s1 {
          edges {
            P : #s2
                #s2
          }
        }
    ```
    In this result, the `P` edge is duplicated in the scope graph, but there is
    still only a single query result.

It is required to declare edge labels in a `signature` section:

```statix
signature

  name-resolution
    labels
      $Label+
```

Label are just uppercase identifiers. They must adhere to the following regular
expression: `[A-Z] [A-Za-z0-9\_]`. It is not allowed to shadow label names, nor
may [modules](../modules) import equivalent label names from different modules.


## Declarations

Declarations in a scope graph can be asserted as follows:

```statix
!$Relation[$Term*] in $Scope
```

This constraint asserts that the terms inside the square brackets are
associated with scope `$Scope` under relation `$Relation`.

Regarding the static semantics of this constraint, `$Scope` is a term which
should have type `scope`. Additionally, the term arguments must adhere to the
signature of the relation. The signature of a relation must be provided in
a `signature` section:

```statix
signature

  relations
    $Relation : {$Type "*"}*
```

Just as [rules](../rules#functional-rules), relations can alternatively be
declared in a functional style:

```statix
$Relation : {$Type "*"}* -> $Type
```

The style of declaration is importand when doing [queries](../queries), but
asserting declarations is similar for both types of relations. When asserting
a declaration for a functional relation, the terms that the relation maps to
should be provided as the last term in the square brackets.

Instead of in a `signature` section, relations can be declared in a
[`rules` section](../rules#injections-of-namespaces-and-relations) as well.

It is allowed to have multiple declaration assertions for a single relation in
the same scope, even when the data of the different relations are equivalent. In
the latter case, multiple equivalent declarations will be inserted in the scope
graph.


## Permission to Extend

In order to make [query](../queries) execution sound, Statix statically limits
to which scopes new edges or declarations may be added (adding a edge or
declaration is often called extending). Scope extension is only allowed in the
following cases:

1. Scopes that are freshly instantiated in a rule using `new` constraints may be
   extended by that rule, and any user-defined constraint that is instantiated
   by that rule.
2. Scopes that are passed as direct argument to a rule may be extended by that
   rule, given that the scope may be extended by rule that instantiated that
   constraint. This property is validated at the instantiation site.
3. Uninstantiated scope variables that are passed directly to a user-defined
   constraint in which they are instantiated may be extended by the outer
   constraint as well. However, this does not hold for input/output values of
   [functional rules](../rules#functional-rules)

These rules prevent extension of scopes that are obtained by pattern matching/
deconstruction.


## Namespaces and Occurrences

!!! warning
    Since Spoofax 2.5.15, namespaces and occurrences are deprecated.
