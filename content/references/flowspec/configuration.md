We will show you how to prepare your project for use with FlowSpec, and write your first small specification.


## Prepare your project

You can start using FlowSpec by creating a new project, or by modifying an existing project. See below for the steps for your case.
### Start a new project

If you have not done this already, install Spoofax Eclipse, by following the [installation instructions](http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/start.html).

Create a new project by selecting `New > Project...` from the menu. Selecting `Spoofax > Spoofax language project` from the list, and click `Next`. After filling in a project name, an identifier, name etc will be automatically suggested. Select `NaBL2` as the analysis type, FlowSpec builds on top of NaBL2â€™s analysis infrastructure. Click `Finish` to create the project.

Add the following dependencies in the metaborg.yaml file:

```
---
# ...
dependencies:
  compile:
  - org.metaborg:flowspec.lang:${metaborgVersion}
  source:
  - org.metaborg:flowspec.lang:${metaborgVersion}
```

Add menus to access the result of analysis, by adding the following import to editor/Main.esv.

```
module Main

imports

  flowspec/Menus
```

### Convert an existing project

If you have an existing project, and you want to start using FlowSpec, there are a few changes you need to make.

First of all, make sure the `metaborg.yaml` file contains at least the following dependencies.

```
---
# ...
dependencies:
  compile:
  - org.metaborg:org.metaborg.meta.nabl2.lang:${metaborgVersion}
  - org.metaborg:flowspec.lang:${metaborgVersion}
  source:
  - org.metaborg:org.metaborg.meta.nabl2.shared:${metaborgVersion}
  - org.metaborg:org.metaborg.meta.nabl2.runtime:${metaborgVersion}
  - org.metaborg:flowspec.lang:${metaborgVersion}
```

We will set things up, such that analysis rules will be grouped together in the directory `trans/analysis`. Create a file `trans/analysis/main.str` that contains the following.

```
module analysis/main

imports

  nabl2shared
  nabl2runtime
  analysis/-
```

Add the following lines to your main `trans/LANGUAGE.str`.

```
module LANGUAGE

imports

  analysis/main

rules

  editor-analyze = nabl2-analyze(desugar-pre)
```

If your language does not have a desugaring step, use `nabl2-analyze(id)` instead.

Add an NaBL2 specification. The most minimal one is the following.

```
module analysis/minimal

rules

init.

[[ _ ]].
```

Running and integrating the FlowSpec analysis is explained on the [Stratego API page](http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/flowspec/stratego-api.html).

Finally, we will add reference resolution and menus to access the result of analysis, by adding the following lines to `editor/Main.esv`.

```
module Main

imports

  nabl2/References
  nabl2/Menus
  flowspec/Menus

```
You can now continue to the [example specification here](http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/flowspec/examples.html), or directly to the [language reference](http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/flowspec/reference.html).

## Inspecting analysis results

You can debug your specification by inspecting the result of analysis.

The result of analysis can be inspected, by selecting elements from the `Spoofax > FlowSpec Analysis` the menu. For multi-file projects, use the `Project` results, or the `File` results for single-file projects. The result is given as a control-flow graph annotated with data-flow properties in the DOT format used by GraphViz. If you have GraphViz installed, you can set the `dot` executable in the settings of the graphviz editor to allow you to jump straight from Eclipse to the rendered graph.
