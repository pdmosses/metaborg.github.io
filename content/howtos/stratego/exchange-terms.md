# Exchange Terms

The term format described above is used in Stratego programs to denote
terms, but is also used to exchange terms between programs. Thus, the
internal format and the external format exactly coincide. Of course,
internally a Stratego program uses a data-structure in memory with
pointers rather than manipulating a textual representation of terms. But
this is completely hidden from the Stratego programmer.
