Spoofax is an open source project. We welcome contributions from the community.

Spoofax is developed by the [TU Delft Programming Languages group][1]. We do our best to make Spoofax usable by everyone and to help you when you encounter issues. However, our resources are limited, so please be patient.


#### :fontawesome-solid-circle-question:&nbsp; I have a question
The search functionality of this documentation should bring you right to a relevant [How-to](../howtos/index.md) or [Reference](../references/index.md) page.

If this doesn't answer your question, please join us in the [SLDE/#spoofax-users](https://slde.slack.com/archives/C7254SF60) Slack channel and ask your question there. To get access, drop [us](https://eelcovisser.org/) a line.

Please do *not* make an issue with your question on the Github repository.


#### :fontawesome-solid-bug:&nbsp; I found a bug
Search the [Issues](https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax/issues) to ensure the bug has not been reported before.

If the bug is new, open a new issue with a _clear title and description_.
Please indicate:

- what you did (i.e., how to reproduce),
- what you expected to happen,
- what actually happened,
- what version of Spoofax and Eclipse you are using, and
- any logs, exceptions, and stack traces relevant to the bug.

Try to include as much relevant information as you have.
For example, a code sample or executable test case are very helpful.

??? tip "Getting the Spoofax and Eclipse version"
    In Eclipse, go to the _Spoofax (meta)_ menu, and click _Report issue_. Copy the displayed version information from this dialog into your issue.
