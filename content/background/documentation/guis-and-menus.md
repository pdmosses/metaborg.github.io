# How to document GUIs and Menus
To describe (a sequence of) menu items or GUI elements, you can format them using the `gui` inline language, and separate them with `>`. For example, this describes a preferences sequence in Eclipse:

```markdown
Open the `#!gui General > Startup and Shutdown` settings page.
```

It is rendered as:

> Open the `#!gui General > Startup and Shutdown` settings page.
