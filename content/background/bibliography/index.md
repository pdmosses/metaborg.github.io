# Spoofax Bibliography

Spoofax and its meta-languages have been described and motivated extensively in the academic literature.
All references to Spoofax-related papers should have been collected in [a bibliography](https://researchr.org/bibliography/metaborg-spoofax/publications) on researchr from where the complete collection of [bibtex entries](https://researchr.org/downloadbibtex/bibliography/metaborg-spoofax) can be obtained.
(Let us know if we are missing publications in that collection.)
This section provides references to that literature.

## Spoofax

The first version of Spoofax was described in an award winning paper OOPSLA 2010[@KatsV10].
(The paper won the best (student) paper award at OOPSLA 2010 and the Most Influential Paper Award at OOPSLA 2020.)
The paper provides motivation for textual language workbenches and discusses the architecture of a language workbench based on declarative meta-languages.

An introduction to Spoofax was included along with introductions to MPS and Xtext in VÃ¶lter's DSL Engineering book[@DslEngineering2013].

A paper in IEEE Software[@WachsmuthKV14] considers Spoofax from a user's perspective.

Spoofax was also one of the tools featured in a survey of language workbenches which was first published in SLE'13[@ErdwegSV13] and later extended in the Computer Languages journal[@ErdwegSVTBCGH0L15].
