# Spoofax 2.4.1 (29-01-2018)

Spoofax 2.4.1 is a minor bugfix release.

## Changes

-   Fix: remove dependency on `nativebundle` from `jsglr2`, preventing
    native binaries (with a cygwin vulnerability) from showing up in
    Spoofax Core.
-   Update `jackson-core`, `jackson-databind`, `jackson-annotations`,
    `jackson-dataformat-yaml` dependencies to `2.9.3` to avoid a
    vulnerability in those libraries.
-   Update `commons-configuration2` to `2.2`,
    `commons-configuration2-jackson` to `0.7.0`, and `snakeyaml` to
    `1.18`, for compatibility with `jackson` version `2.9.3`.
