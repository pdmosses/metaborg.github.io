# Spoofax 2.5.3 (02-05-2019)

Spoofax 2.5.3 is a minor release with bugfixes, performance
improvements, and new small and/or experimental features.

## Changes

### Overall

-   Added support for getting the selected term in Stratego
    builders/transformations. In the builder tuple
    `(node, _, ast, path, projectPath)`, the first term (`node`) is now
    the selected term when a builder is executed in the context of an
    editor with a selection. The term is selected by finding the
    outermost term that has an origin that fits in the selection.
-   Fixed a bug that prevented source transformations from being run if
    context or analysis were missing.
-   Changed constraint analyzer to support more multi-file scenarios.

### JSGLR2

-   Added an incremental variant of the JSGLR2 parser (experimental).

### NaBL2

-   Improved preformance of AST resolution lookups.

### Statix (experimental)

-   Fixed bugs and improved performance.

### Eclipse

-   Added a lifecycle mapping that adds a Spoofax nature to an imported
    spoofax-project.
