# Spoofax 2.5.0 (11-09-2018)

Spoofax 2.5 introduces FlowSpec, a new meta-language for
intra-procedural data-flow analysis; layout-sensitive parsing in SDF3;
and has several small improvements and bug fixes.

## Changes

### Maven

We updated the Guice version that Spoofax uses to 4.2.0. This has the
cascading effect that we need Maven 3.5.4, since Spoofax is used in a
maven plugin. Be sure to have this version of Maven installed, or you
will run into `MethodNotFoundException` s for
`com.google.inject.internal.*`.

### Core

The `constraint` analyzer was generalized:

-   The `constraint` analyzer is now independent of NaBL2, and can be
    used as a generic analysis mechanism from Stratego. The analysis
    cycle and the Stratego interface to it are defined ans documented in
    module `libspoofax/analysis/constraint`.
-   Fixed a bug where ambiguity errors were not always correctly
    reported.

### FlowSpec

This release introduces FlowSpec, a new meta-language for
intra-procedural data-flow analysis. See the documentation of the
language for more details.

### Stratego

Stratego received some small patches to improve user experience.

-   Stratego editor now gives warnings when using `left`, `right` and a
    couple of other variables names as these are also constructors in
    libstratego-sglr and interpreted as constructor match patterns.
-   When the Stratego compiler generates names for code generation,
    these now start with the source code name if available or with a
    constant name related to the language feature (e.g. a `where(s)` is
    turned into `?where243;s;!where243`). Since some generated names
    turn up in a stack trace from a Stratego, this should improve
    readability of the stack trace. Complex closures are still named
    `lifted26`, as the compiler cannot replace humans in properly naming
    things.

### SPT

Problems related to escaping in string terms of expectations are fixed:

-   Double quotes (`"`) in expectation require escaping using
    backslashes, but were not unescaped when comparing with actual parse
    results. This made correct tests containing double quotes in strings
    fail. This is fixed by unescaping the expectation terms.
-   Formatting expectation terms as strings was different than default
    ATerms (`"` and `\` were not escaped), which was confusing when a
    test fails and the actual and expected terms were reported. This is
    fixed by aligning the SPT expectation terms formatting with default
    ATerm formatting.

### NaBL2

Small usability improvements:

-   Empty parameter tuples in rules can be omitted.
-   Accidentally writing a dot instead of a comma before a recursive
    rule invocation could make that constraint look like a rule without
    constraints. Layout is now used to give a warning when such a case
    is written.
-   Fix import problems caused by `nabl2.runtime` exports. The exports
    are restricted such that layout syntax and DynSem signatures are not
    exported anymore. The sorts defined by the runtime are all prefixed
    with `NaBL2` to prevent accidental merges with sorts from the
    importing language.
-   Allow all Stratego identifiers to be used as constructor names.

Solver changes:

-   Adopt new naming convention, with packages named `mb.nabl2.*`, and
    artifacts named `nabl2.*`.
-   Add classes for matching and subtitution of terms, independent of
    unification.
-   Use the generalized `constraint` analyzer for the NaBL2 analysis
    strategy.

### SDF3

The experimental support for generating Scala case classes from an SDF3
specification was removed. It was incomplete, unmaintained and unused.

Added support for
`Layout Declarations <layout-declarations>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for layout-sensitive parsing and pretty-printing.

### Eclipse

Small fixes and improvements:

-   Execute builders for languages which have no analysis defined.
    Previously builders would always wait until an analysis result was
    produced.
-   Cancel running SPT test suites. It is now possible to cancel a
    running SPT test suite in the progress window.

### IntelliJ

Small fixes and improvements:

-   Can now be installed into any latest IntelliJ, not just the last
    version we tested
-   By default runs in IntelliJ 2018.1.1
-   Simplified project structure
-   Updated dependencies
-   Changes to support Java 9 in the future
