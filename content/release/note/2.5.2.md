# Spoofax 2.5.2 (12-03-2019)

Spoofax 2.5.2 is a minor bugfix and performance improvement release.

## Changes

### NaBL2

A bug introduced in 2.5.2 would remove the parse error in the editor as
soon as analysis failed. This bug has been fixed.

### FlowSpec

A whole host of bugs has been fixed in FlowSpec, mostly ones that lead
to no clear error message. Much of the system has also been optimized
for speed.

### Stratego

Separate compilation for Stratego was added in this release. It is
currently still experimental. It is documented as a separate item under
the Stratego documentation, including instructions on how to opt-in to
it and what its limitations are.

The Stratego primitives `all`, `some` and `one` sometimes lost
annotations and origins of list tails when an element in the list was
transformed. This bug has been fixed.

The Stratego editor used to give spurious errors on missing variable
definitions if those were list variables that were bound in a concrete
syntax pattern. This long-standing bug has been fixed in this release.
