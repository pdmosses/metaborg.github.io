# Spoofax 2.5.16 (04-06-2021)

Spoofax 2.5.16 contains a couple of small improvements and bug fixes.

## Changes

### SDF3

* Fix a bug with the automatic generation of namespaced grammars, which was introduced in the previous release.

### Statix

* Added `stc-get-ast-ref` rule to the Stratego API, which can be used to query `ref` properties.
* The Stratego primitives now issue console warnings when invalid labels or properties are used.
* Fixed a bug where `stx-get-scopegraph-data` would return unification variables instead of their values.
* Changed the default data order to `true`, to make queries where only a label order is provided apply shadowing as expected.
* Added a menu option to execute tests with the concurrent solver.
* Fixed a completeness bug in the traditional solver when executing queries in dataWf or dataLeq predicates.
