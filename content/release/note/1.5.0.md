# Spoofax 1.5.0 (18-12-2015)

We're happy to announce the release of Spoofax 1.5.0 with new SDF3 features and fixes, and support for Eclipse Mars.

## Changes

### SDF3

* Feature: [support for case insensitive keywords](http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/954). All keywords in a template production are case insensitive if the production has the attribute `case-insensitive`.
* Feature: pretty-print ambiguous programs (by taking the first alternative).
* Feature: give an error if the filename does not match the module name.
* Fix: [ESV generation with empty imports](http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/970).
* Fix: disallow empty placeholders `<>` in template productions.

### Eclipse

* Feature: support for Eclipse Mars.

### Command-line tools

* Fix: Sunshine now pretty-prints ATerms before presenting them, mimicking the behavior in Eclipse.
