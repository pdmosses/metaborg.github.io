# Spoofax 2.1.0 (10-01-2017)

Spoofax 2.1 improves on Spoofax 2.0 with several bug fixes, an
implementation of syntactic completions based on SDF3, and addition of
the DynSem dynamic semantics specification meta-language.

See the corresponding
`migration guide <2.1.0-migration-guide>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for migrating from Spoofax 2.0 to Spoofax 2.1.

## Changes

### Syntactic Completions

Spoofax now has support for syntactic completions. Syntactic completions
are generated automatically from an SDF3 specification. New projects
using SDF3 automatically support syntactic completions. Existing
projects need to make a few changes, documented in the
`migration guide <new-completion-framework-migration-guide>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### DynSem

DynSem is a DSL for concise and modular specification of dynamic
semantics of programming languages. Fully functional interpreters are
automatically derived from dynamic semantics specifications. For more
information about DynSem, see the following sources:

-   `Getting started tutorial <dynsem-getting-started>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
-   [Example language](https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/simpl)

While DynSem was included in Spoofax 2.0.0, we did not advertise this as
it was still under heavy development. Since 2.0.0, the following major
improvements were made:

1.  [Redesigned semantic component and explication
    subsystem](https://github.com/metaborg/dynsem/pull/98)
2.  [Support for tuples](https://github.com/metaborg/dynsem/pull/93)
3.  `Updated tutorial for SIMPL <dynsem-getting-started>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
4.  `Added support for unit testing and continuous integration of generated interpreters <dynsem-ci>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
