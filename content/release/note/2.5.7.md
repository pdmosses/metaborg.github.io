# Spoofax 2.5.7 (26-06-2019)

Spoofax 2.5.7 includes minor bugfixes and improvements to the
experimental Stratego separate compiler.

## Changes

### FlowSpec

Bugfix: Names with namespaces were broken in an earlier version during
performance optimization. The error would like:
`java.lang.AssertionError: Unrecognised Namespace: Namespace("Var")`.

### Stratego

Stratego separate compilation is now switched to the new system. It no
longer has any limitations that were previously mentioned. Do note that
separate compilation will give the same stricter error messages that the
editor does: You need to import anything you use, you cannot use
something that another module imports that imports your module.
