# Spoofax 2.4.0 (09-01-2018)

Spoofax 2.4 fixes several bugs and includes a program generator.

## Changes

### Eclipse Plugin

-   Fix: re-parse and re-analyze open editors if the language is
    reloaded.

### NaBL2

-   Fix: use deep equality instead of object equality to compare
    elements in set constraints.
-   Fix: prevent clashes of variable names with known lower-case
    Stratego constructors.
-   Improvement: add strategies to the Stratego API to query references
    and declaration associated with AST nodes.
-   Fix: prevent exception traces when hovering over the editor.
-   Fix: bug in Stratego generation when complex terms are used in
    occurrences.
-   Fix: bug where editor resolution would only consider leaf nodes, but
    not parents if the leafs do not resolve.
-   Fix: bug where sometimes error messages of files were lost.

### Parser

-   Improvement: latest JSGLR2 performance optimizations.
-   Fix: bug in JSGLR2 where non-default start symbols were not taken
    into account.
