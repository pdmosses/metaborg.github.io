# Spoofax 2.5.13 (20-11-2020)

Spoofax 2.5.13 contains a couple of small improvements.

## Changes

### SDF3

`prefer` and `avoid` are now deprecated. Usages of the operators will be
marked with a deprecation warning.

### Parser

The JSGLR2 parser variants now report warnings on ambiguously parsed
substrings. This includes ambiguities in lexical and layout syntax that
do not result into `amb` nodes in the AST.

### SPT

The `run` expectation now allows to call strategies with term arguments.
It\'s now also possible to test if a strategy failed. See the SPT
documentation for more details.
