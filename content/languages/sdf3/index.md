# SDF3 Syntax Definition Formalism
SDF3 is the third version of the Syntax Definition Formalism meta-language in Spoofax for defining the syntax of a language, which is used for both parsing an input into an Abstract Syntax Tree, and to provide syntax highlighting.  Through the use of _templates_ SDF3 can also be used to define a pretty-printer.
